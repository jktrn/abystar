Using her Elemental Skill will transform it into \"Impale the Night\": Perform a lunging attack, dealing\nElectro DMG\n.

The shots she fires can pierce opponents, and DMG dealt to opponents in their path is increased.\nImpale the Night\nThe current percentage value of Clorinde's Bond of Life determines its effect:\n\u00b7 When the Bond of Life value is 0%, perform a normal lunging strike;\n\u00b7 When the Bond of Life value is less than 100% of her max HP, Clorinde is healed based on the Bond of Life value, and the AoE of the lunging attack and the DMG dealt is increased;\n\u00b7 When the value of the Bond of Life is equal to or greater than 100% of her max HP, use Impale the Night: Pact. The healing multiplier is increased, and the AoE and DMG dealt by the lunge is increased even further.\nIn addition, when Clorinde is in the Night Vigil state, healing effects other than Impale the Night will not take effect and will instead be converted into a Bond of Life that is a percentage of the healing that would have been received.\nClorinde will exit the \"Night Vigil\" state when she leaves the field.\nArkhe: Ousia\nPeriodically, when Clorinde's Swift Hunt shots strike opponents, she will summon a Surging Blade at the position hit that deals Ousia-aligned\nElectro DMG\n.\nThough the evil that lurked in the shadows of the night had been purged across thousands of years, a shadow that the light could not reach clouded human hearts.\nEven now, the warning left by the Golden Hunter is etched into her memory: Those of the Night Vigil, carrying aloft lit candles against the blackness, have greater need still to remain vigilant.
